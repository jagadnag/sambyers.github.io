Earlier today I and a few engineers from Cisco spoke on applications of SDN in our current portfolio. We sopke on iWAN, ACI, and Meraki SD-WAN. This was a great webinar focused on detailing SDN solutions at the nuts and bolts level. We had Network Academy students ask awesome questions about the solutions and what we thought about the market for SDN now and in the future. I had a lot of fun fielding questions about iWAN and the future of SD-WAN. Dana and Shiyue did phenomenal jobs breaking down ACI and Meraki SD-WAN.

SD-WAN is only going to develop further as the market grows. Enterprises are either going to take the reigns by adopting this technology or acquire it from partners or service providers. I think the choice to buy or integrate will be a business decision on whether there is value in building a practice around WAN excellence.

A business that delivers their value over the WAN will want to build a strong practice so they can deliver the best experience for their customers. An example would be a distance learning business that sources content from disparate remote locations. They would want to ensure their real time and streaming content is as good as it can be. SD-WAN provides a way to do this by leveraging multiple carriers and transports, measuring performance, and allowing software to make path selections.
